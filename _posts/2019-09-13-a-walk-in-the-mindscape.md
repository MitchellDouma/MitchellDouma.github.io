This project took the skills I developed from Duck Hunt to a whole new level.  This is the first game I've made using Monogame. When I was in grade 10, I made a text based adventure game in basic.  I thought it would be cool to give that game graphics and controls.  This was the result.  I made all of the backgrounds and sprite sheets in photoshop. I also created sound effects and music using Famitracker.  I wanted the game to have an NES vibe mainly because I really like chiptune and wanted to try making 8-bit looking sprites.

The game is very similar to the original Legend of Zelda. The player can collect items, kill enemies, and explorer several different landscapes.  The main objective of the game is to defeat the dragon that has made its home in the castle's treasure room.  Before the player can defeat the dragon, they must travel around the world to collect items that will help them in the fight.  The hearts on the side of the screen display the players health.  There are several items in the game that can increase the players maximum health.  Every time the player defeats an enemy, there is a possibility that they will regain one of their lost hearts.  The player can also find a sword, bombs, and a key. The sword can help the player slay enemies.  The bombs can destroy fragile walls that have goodies on the other side. The key opens the door to the castle.

 The A.I. and animation were similar to the ones that I made in the Duck Hunt game, but this time I created my own sprite sheets.  I also created multiple screens for the player to explorer.  This was a fun project because it gave me more insight as to how both professional and indie games are actually made as well as how much work they really are.
