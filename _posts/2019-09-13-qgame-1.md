This project was a step up from the Tic Tac Toe game.  This game incorporates the skills I learned in making the calculator and Tic Tac Toe as well as File I/O.  The game is essentially a block puzzle game. These types of puzzles are common in puzzle/adventure type games such as Legend of Zelda.  The premise of the puzzle is that the player needs to get the blocks to a specific location, but the floor is ice; so when the player pushes a block, the block will slide along the floor until it hits a wall or another block.

In this program, players can also design levels for other people to play.  There is a toolbox on the side of the screen that has all of the items that the game can have.  There is also two text boxes on the top of the screen that correlate to the amount of rows and columns of image boxes on the screen.  The designer begins by typing a number in each of the two text boxes at the top, and then clicks the generate button. This makes the grid of image boxes that the designer can now place items into.  There are four different coloured blocks,  each with a corresponding door, walls and an eraser tool.  The designer selects an object by clicking on the button of the object they wish to use, and then they click the image box that they want the object to be on. When the designer is finished, they can click on the file dropdown and then click the save level button. This will create a file that stores the designers level in a special code.

When someone wants to play a game. They have to load a level by clicking the file dropdown and then clicking the load level button.  The program will then read the file and make the level.  The player can only move blocks. When a player clicks on a block, the block is selected. Now they can move the block by pressing one of the four buttons on the side of the screen. Each button represents a direction that the block can move to.  When the player clicks a button, the selected block will move in that direction until it hits a wall, door, or another block.  There is a number on the side of the screen that counts how many moves the player has made so far. If the door that the block hit is the same colour, the block disappears.  Once all of the blocks reach their corresponding doors, a message box appears stating that the player has won.
