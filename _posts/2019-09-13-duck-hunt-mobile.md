This project was my first attempt at making a mobile game.  I wanted to make a mobile version of the Classic NES game Duck Hunt.  In the game, there are several ducks that fly around. The player has to shoot the ducks to get points.  I used the original sprite sheets to animate the ducks. This was my first attempt at making A.I. and animation in a game.

Ducks fly around on the screen. The black duck moves slowly, so it is worth 10 points when the player shoots it.  The red duck is faster, so it is worth 20 points. The blue duck is really fast, so it is worth 50 points.  The player shoots the ducks simply by taping their screen. The yellow number at the top of the screen shows how many points the player has.
