I started making this calculator to help me practice using Windows Forms. It's a very basic calculator.  Whenever the user clicks a button with a number, symbol, or decimal on it, the text box will display the value that was assigned to the button. When the user clicks a button with an operation on it, whatever number is already in the text box will be converted into a double and stored as the first value. Then the operation will appear on the textbox beside the first value. The user then inputs another number after the operation, and it is displayed in the textbox and stored as the second value.  When the user clicks the equals button, the program will then look at what the operation is and apply that to the first and second values.  When the user clicks the CE button, the memory is wiped clean.
