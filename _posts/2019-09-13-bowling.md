This is the first game I made using the Unity engine.  It's a simple bowling game that I made will learning how to use Unity.  I was primarily focused on how to program games using Unity, so I didn't really take time to make attractive looking models or HUD.

The player can move the ball with the A and D keys. They can also apply spin to the ball with the Q and E keys.  When the player want to throw the ball, they hold the space bar until they get their desired amount of power, and then they release the space bar.  The ball will then receive a forward velocity based on the power that the player had given it.  After the ball has been released, the program will wait for about 10 seconds. After those 10 seconds, the program will tally up how many pins have fallen over and note which ones haven't.  Then the ball will return to its original position along with the pins that hadn't toppled over during the last throw.  The player then lines up their shot again and throws the ball at the pins.  The same thing will happen as last time. After the second shot, the program move the player to the next end, and this repeats for ten ends.  If a player gets a strike, the program will move the player to the next end without having to take a second shot.  The program automatically tallies up the points and displays the results at the end of the game.
