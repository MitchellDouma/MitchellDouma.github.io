In this project, I wanted to take bump up my Windows Forms skills a little and make a simple tic tac toe game.

There is a label on the side of the screen that displays whose turn it is. It always starts with X. When the first player clicks an image box, an X will appear in the box. The label will then say it is O's turn.  When the second player clicks an image box, an O will appear in the box.  After every turn, the program will check to see if there is a winner by looking at each row, column, and diagonal to see if all of the images in the three image boxes are the same. If none are, then the game will resume. If one is, Then a message box will pop up that says which player won based on whichever image is the same across the three image boxes in a row that are similar.  If all of the boxes have been filled with an image, and there isn't any similarity within any of the rows. A message box will pop up that says it's a tie.
