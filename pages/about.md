I am a third year student at Conestoga College in the Innovation and Design for Information Technology program.  I've had an interest in programming since I was in high school and have taught myself many programming languages such as basic, C#, Java, javascript, SQL, and python.  I am also well versed in several Adobe programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and Flash.
